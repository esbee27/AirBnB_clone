# Introduction - AirBnb Project

The project aims at creating a command Enterpreter(Console) that could be used to manage all class models and objects.

The console works like any other command prompt but in this project scenario it will be limited to:

- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, we were guided to  achieve the following learning Objectives

        How to create a Python package
        How to create a command interpreter in Python using the cmd module
        What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
        How to serialize and deserialize a Class
        How to write and read a JSON file
        How to manage datetime
        What is an UUID
        What is *args and how to use it
        What is **kwargs and how to use it
        How to handle named arguments in a function
